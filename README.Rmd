# CLPFUDatabase

## Statement of need

Historically, societal exergy analysis (SEA) practitioners have
analyzed the energy conversion chains (ECCs)
of individual countries using linked spreadsheets,
often starting with primary- and final-stage data 
from the [International Energy Agency][link-iea]'s (IEA's)
[extended world energy balances][link-ieaeweb] (EWEBs)
[@Ayres:2003ec; @Serrenho:2014aa; @Brockway:2014aa; @Brockway:2015aa]. 
Data were stored in varying and inconsistent formats.
An early SEA database [@De-Stercke:2014]
estimated energy efficiencies 
of end-use machines using the economic status of countries,
thereby precluding use in energy-economy studies.

Researchers in the field
wanted to expand SEA to cover all countries, but
the spreadsheet approach to SEA was
deemed not scalable.
A new approach to SEA was needed, 
one that scaled across all countries 
for many years without relying on economic data
to estimate machine efficiencies. 

To address that need,
we created a suite of `R` packages 
to support the creation and use of the CL-PFU database.
But creating the CL-PFU database involves 
more than 10 `R` packages and
much input data.
With so many `R` packages involved, 
a way to streamline the installation of packages was needed,
such that a single `install.packages()` would
ensure that all dependencies are available.

This package (`CLPFUDatbase`) addresses the need for a simple 
way to install all dependencies.
`CLPFUDatbase` is 
metapackage^[A metapackage with which many `R` programmers 
             will be familiar is [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).], 
whose dependencies include all packages required to make
the CL-PFU database. 
Installation of `CLPFUDatabase` triggers 
installation of all dependencies for the CL-PFU database.


## Installation

You can install `CLPFUDatabase` and all its dependencies
from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EnergyEconomyDecoupling/CLPFUDatabase")
```
